# 🖧 Cisco Packet Tracer – Peer-to-Peer & Client-Server Networks

This project demonstrates two network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer:
1. **Peer-to-Peer Network** with statically assigned IPs
2. **Client-Server Network** with DHCP server configuration

These labs were created as part of a hands-on learning activity to reinforce networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, switching, and connectivity testing using ICMP (ping).

## 📁 Topologies Covered

### 1️⃣ Peer-to-Peer Network

- Devices: 1x Switch, 4x PCs
- Connections: Copper straight-through cables
- IP Assignment: Static  
- Verified via: `ping` across all PCs  
- Network range: `192.168.1.x/24`

### 2️⃣ Client-Server Network

- Devices: 1x Switch, 1x Server, 2x PCs  
- Connections: Copper straight-through  
- IP Assignment: DHCP via Server  
- Server IP: `192.168.1.2`  
- Gateway: `192.168.1.1`

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Static IP configuration
- DHCP server setup in Packet Tracer
- Cable selection and physical topology building
- Testing connectivity using the ping command
- Understanding client-server vs. peer-to-peer models

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
2. Open the `.pkt` file included in this repo
3. Review topology layouts
4. Open terminal on each PC and run `ping` to test connections
